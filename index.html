            <p> I was born in Havana, Cuba on November 22d, 1991. I lived there for my first six years and immigrated to Miami, Florida in 1997. I fell in love with martial arts when I was 15 years old after watching UFC 66 live on pay per view, that day shapped the rest of my life. Diving into the different martial arts taught me about humility, patience, self belief, peace, love, kinship and perseverance. At the same time I was enrolled it Felix Varela highs Navy JOTC program, learning all about discipline, responsibilities and teamwork. While I was growing up in both of those worlds I was completely engulfed in the Harry Potter franchise, not growing up with a father meant I was forced to find my own male rolemodels. My role models have always been fictional characters and because of that I had a beautiful childhood. After highschool I felt lost for years, trying to enjoy life while simultaneously trying to figure out what to do with it wasnt as easy as it seemed. Ive lived a lot and loved every second of it but right before I signed up for UMs coding bootcamp I read a book that changed my life. Own the Day by Aubrey Marcus, that book is the reason I am writing this today and the reason my life has purpose and direction. Now I am a student of web develpment and I am excited to become a true programer and find my niche within the field.</p>
